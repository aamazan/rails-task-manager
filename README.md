Specs
Your model

Before getting started with your routes, your controller and the views, generate your model:

    Use rails generate model <ModelName> <attr1>:<type> <attr2>:<type> .. to create the model and associated migration all at the same time.
    If you forget a field in your model, you can use rails generate migration <MigrationName> to automatically create a new migration file with the required timestamps.
    Remember, you still have to run the rails db:migrate to execute your migrations.
    Once that's done, play with the Rails console. This is IRB-on-steroids that enables you to interact with your Rails application from the command line. You can try to add new tasks to your DB directly from the command line.

Routing

Your To Do app should have 7 entry points in the routing:

    GET '/tasks': get all your tasks.
    GET '/tasks/:id': get a precise task, e.g GET '/tasks/3' fetches the task with id=3
    GET '/tasks/new': get the form to create a new task
    POST '/tasks': post a new task
    GET '/tasks/:id/edit': get the form to edit an existing task
    PATCH '/tasks/:id': update an existing task
    DELETE '/tasks/:id': delete an existing task

You will also have to create a TasksController with 7 actions related to those 7 routes. For the names of these actions, use the Rails naming convention:

    index
    show
    new
    create
    edit
    update
    destroy

Guidelines on Views

index.html.erb

    Should display a list of all tasks and, for each task:
        a link to its show view (use a link_to helper)
        a link to its edit view
        a link to its delete action. Hint: a standard link does not allow DELETE requests, so here you should add a method: :delete option to your link_to helper.
    Should include a link to the new view to create a new task

show.html.erb

    Should display the task's details (content, date of creation, etc.) and a back-link to the index page.

new.html.erb and edit.html.erb

    Should include a form to create or update a task.

Important

Notice that creating (as well as updating) a task is a 2-requests process:

    A first GET request displays the HTML form
    A second POST or PATCH request enables us to actually create or update the task using the parameters submitted in the form.

Controller actions do not necessarily need a view. For instance, the create update & destroy actions. All they do is perform operations on the DB and then redirect_to another URL... so we don't need views for them, right?
When you are done

Once you have finished the exercise and have a fully-functioning To Do app, refactor your code:

    Use a partial to factor the new and edit HTML forms.
    Use the form_for helper to build your new/edit form.
    Refactor your routes with the resources routing method.
