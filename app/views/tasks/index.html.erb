<!--
Should display a list of all tasks and, for each task:
        a link to its show view (use a link_to helper)
        a link to its edit view
        a link to its delete action. Hint: a standard link does not allow DELETE requests, so here you should add a method: :delete option to your link_to helper.
    Should include a link to the new view to create a new task
